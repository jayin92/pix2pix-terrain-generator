# Depth Of Field

The Depth Of Field component applies a depth of field effect, which simulates the focus properties of a camera lens. In real life, a camera can only focus sharply on an object at a specific distance; objects nearer or farther from the camera are out of focus. The blurring gives a visual cue about an objectâ€™s distance, and introduces Bokeh, which refers to visual artifacts that appear around bright areas of the image as they fall out of focus.

## Using Depth Of Field

**Depth Of Field** uses the [Volume](Volumes.html) framework, so to enable and modify **Depth Of Field** properties, you must add a **Depth Of Field** override to a [Volume](Volumes.html) in your Scene. To add **Depth Of Field** to a Volume:

1. In the Scene or Hierarchy view, select a GameObject that contains a Volume component to view it in the Inspector.
2. In the Inspector, navigate to **Add Override > Post-processing** and click on **Depth Of Field**. HDRP now applies **Depth Of Field** to any Camera this Volume affects.

Depth Of Field includes some [advanced properties](Advanced-Properties.html) that you must manually expose.

## Properties

![](Images/Post-ProcessingDepthOfField1.png)

| **Property**       | **Description**                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Focus Mode**     | Use the drop-down to select the mode that HDRP uses to set the focus for the depth of field effect.<br />&#8226; **Off**: Select this option to disable depth of field.<br />&#8226; **Use Physical Camera**: Select this option to use the physical Camera to set focusing properties for the depth of field effect.<br />&#8226; **Manual**: Select this option to use custom values to set the focus of the depth of field effect. |
| **Focus Distance** | Set the distance to the focus point from the Camera.<br />This property only appears when you select **Use Physical Camera** from the **Focus Mode** drop-down. |

### Near Blur

| **Property**     | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Start**        | Set the distance from the Camera at which the near field blur begins to decrease in intensity.<br />This property only appears when you select **Manual** from the **Focus Mode** drop-down. |
| **End**          | Set the distance from the Camera at which the near field does not blur anymore.<br />This property only appears when you select **Manual** from the **Focus Mode** drop-down. |
| **Sample Count** | Set the number of samples to use for the near field. Lower values result in better performance at the cost of visual accuracy. |
| **Max Radius**   | Set the maximum radius the near blur can reach.              |

### Far Blur

| **Property**     | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Start**        | Set the distance from the Camera at which the far field starts blurring.<br />This property only appears when you select **Manual** from the **Focus Mode** drop-down. |
| **End**          | Set the distance from the Camera at which the far field blur reaches its maximum blur radius.<br />This property only appears when you select **Manual** from the **Focus Mode** drop-down. |
| **Sample Count** | Set the number of samples to use for the far field. Lower values result in better performance at the cost of visual accuracy. |
| **Max Radius**   | Set the maximum radius the far blur can reach.               |

### Advanced Tweaks

| **Property**               | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Resolution**             | Use the drop-down to set the resolution at which HDRP processes the depth of field effect. If you target consoles that use a very high resolution (for example, 4k), select **Quarter,** because it is less resource intensive.<br />&#8226; **Quarter**: Uses quarter the screen resolution.<br />&#8226; **Half**: Uses half the screen resolution.<br />This property only appears when you enable the [advanced properties](Advanced-Properties.html). |
| **High Quality Filtering** | Enable the checkbox to make HDRP use bicubic filtering instead of bilinear filtering. This increases the resource intensity of the Depth Of Field effect, but results in smoother visuals.<br />This property only appears when you enable the [advanced properties](Advanced-Properties.html). |
